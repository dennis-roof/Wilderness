/*
 * This is an implementation of Perlin "simplex noise" over one
 * dimension (x), two dimensions (x,y), three dimensions (x,y,z)
 * and four dimensions (x,y,z,w). The analytic derivative is
 * returned, to make it possible to do lots of fun stuff like
 * flow animations, curl noise, analytic antialiasing and such.
 *
 * Visually, this noise is exactly the same as the plain version of
 * simplex noise provided in the file "snoise1234.c". It just returns
 * all partial derivatives in addition to the scalar noise value.
